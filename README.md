UW HUB
===================

UW Hub is on an on-going project with the goal to provide an intuitive platform where UW students can view and interact with all the information they care about in one place. Pulling from [Waterloo's Open Data Api](https://github.com/uWaterloo/api-documentation#accessing-the-api), users have the ability to not only view data like courses or info sessions but they also set alerts for them and recieve in app notifications when events trigger. With the all the data available form the API, expect a lot more coming soon to the app.

Home Page
-------------


####Overview

Home page consists of a list of "View Cards" that are meant to give users a quick glance at information that they can view in more detail elsewhere in the app. The cards are completely dynamic, allowing users to add and remove cards so  that they only see the information they care about. Users can also reorder the cards by dragging the card headers up or down.


####  Actions

 - Swipe cards to the left to remove them
 - Use the fab to add cards
 - Drag the card's header to swap with other cards

Future Plans
-------------
 - Utilize location data for POI for proximity based features 
 - Set up a backend to replace the need for alarm receivers for notifications
